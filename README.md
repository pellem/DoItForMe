Automatic install for Epitech basic tools

You just have to donwload init.sh, chmod it if needed, launch it where you want and let it do the job for you.

Current files versions:

init.sh:
- [x] Create "bin" dir (if it doesn't exists in your ~ (/home/$USER))
- [x] Check if git and zsh are installed (or will install those shit)
- [x] Create a temp directory with exotic name
- [x] Clone this repo (Epitech_Tools.git) in the temp dir
- [x] Move .sh in /home/$USER/bin
- [x] Move zshrc.cfg to /home/$USER/.zsrc
- [x] Remove temp folder
